# Particle-Life

At any time, in case of need, the R key removes every particles

# Experiment 1, vesicles formation:
*Click anywhere to start filling the simulation with green particles
*600 are probably enough (you can see the count in the GUI)
*Click again to stop green particles creation
*Use the A key once, it will introduce a red catalyser particle and start the chain reaction hopefully leading to vesicles formation

# Experiment 2, vesicle reproduction:
*Check "destroy at boundary" in the GUI
*Still in the GUI put "brownian speed to 0"
*Use the S key roughly 30 time to created yellow particles
*You can toggle "centerize" with the C key
Do not forget to disable centerize after, with C key (it's only an help to build a vesicle)
*Use the A key to create a red particle (that will be in the vesicle if this one is centered)
*Click far from the vesicle to start a source of green particle.
If the source looks like a beam it means you forgot to disable centerize with the C key.
(Clicking again stops the green particles production in case of need)
*The vesicle will hopefully feed, grow, and reproduce.
